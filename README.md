2. Place the `skaffold` binary in a directory, for example: `/usr/local/bin`.
3. Add this directory to your PATH (if not already done):
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the command:

     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
     ```

4. To make this change permanent, add the line above to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`), and then source the file:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell
   ```

## 5. Install Ingress Controller

Navigate to the `infra/k8s` directory in your project:

```bash
cd infra/k8s
```

Apply the Ingress controller configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.11.2/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

## 6. Set up JWT Secret in Kubernetes

To add the `jwt-secret` key, follow these steps:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```
Replace `<your-secret-key>` with the actual JWT secret key.

Verify that the secret was created successfully:

``` bash
kubectl get secrets
```

You should see `jwt-secret` listed in the output.

## 7. Start the Project

Once the prerequisites are in place, use Skaffold to start the project.

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the application with Skaffold:

   ```bash
   skaffold dev
   ```

## 8. Push Changes to Your Forked Repository

After making your changes, commit and push them to your forked repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin main
```

Then, open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository, describing the changes you've made. Once submitted, your changes will await review and approval before they can be merged.
